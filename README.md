# heightmap-gen

A simple Clojure library for doing basic heightmap generation for games or 
other graphical programs.

Heightmaps are generated as a grayscale image of NxN pixels where N = 2^x + 1 
for some x. Can be run directly to generate PNG files, or can be called 
as a library to generate the image as a 1D vector of floating-point numbers.

Functionality included at time of writing:
- Diamond-square algorithm
- White noise function
- Various basic filters
